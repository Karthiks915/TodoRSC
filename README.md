# todo_app

A new Flutter project.

## Getting Started

This project is a starting point for a Flutter application.

A simple todo app that uses the following -
1) Riverpod for state management. (Uses Riverpod generation)
2) Isar for local database. 
3) Freezed is code generation for data classes
4) Repository-Service-Controller Pattern.

Future plans-
1) Firebase/Appwrite repository that lets you switch between local and remote database.
2) ChatGPT API that lets you add multiple todos without the need for typing everything manually.
