Simple Todo app to show implementation of Repository Service Controller pattern. 

Checking to see if using a controller with Riverpod is a good idea similar to MVC, or go with a Repository>Riverpod>UI pattern and get rid of the controller.

The app uses the following -

Riverpod for state management. (Uses Riverpod generation)
Isar for local database.
Freezed is code generation for data classes
Repository-Service-Controller Pattern.
