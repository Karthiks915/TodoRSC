A new Flutter project.

Getting Started
Simple Todo app to practice implementation of Repository Service Controller pattern.

The app uses the following -

Riverpod for state management. (Uses Riverpod generation)
Isar for local database.
Freezed is code generation for data classes
Repository-Service-Controller Pattern.
Future plans-

Firebase/Appwrite repository that lets you switch between local and remote database.
ChatGPT API that lets you add multiple todos without the need for typing everything manually.
